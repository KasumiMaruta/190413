<h1 style="color:tomato;">Marimba</h1>
<p style="color:lightsalmon">
    The marimba (/məˈrɪmbə/) is a percussion instrument 
    consisting of a set of wooden bars struck with yarn 
    or rubber mallets to produce musical tones. 
    Resonators or pipes suspended underneath the bars 
    amplify their sound. 
    The bars of a chromatic marimba are arranged like 
    the keys of a piano, with the groups of two and three 
    accidentals raised vertically, overlapping the natural 
    bars to aid the performer both visually and physically. 
    This instrument is a type of idiophone, but with a more 
    resonant and lower-pitched tessitura than the xylophone.
