<h1 style="color:tomato;">Marimba</h1>
<p style="color:lightsalmon">
    The marimba (/məˈrɪmbə/) is a percussion instrument 
    consisting of a set of wooden bars struck with yarn 
    or rubber mallets to produce musical tones. 
    Resonators or pipes suspended underneath the bars 
    amplify their sound. 
    The bars of a chromatic marimba are arranged like 
    the keys of a piano, with the groups of two and three 
    accidentals raised vertically, overlapping the natural 
    bars to aid the performer both visually and physically. 
    This instrument is a type of idiophone, but with a more 
    resonant and lower-pitched tessitura than the xylophone.

<h1 style="color: teal">Double bass</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen">
    The Double bass is a stringed instrument and can produce 
    low pitched sounds. 
    The double bass player stands, or sits on a high stool, 
    and leans the instrument against their body, turned slightly 
    inward to put the strings comfortably in reach. 
    This stance is a key reason for the bass's sloped shoulders, 
    which mark it apart from the other members of the violin family
    —the narrower shoulders facilitate playing the strings 
    in their higher registers.
    A standard size of the Double bass is 195 cm, and it have 4 strings.
    The double bass is played with bow or by plucking the strings.
    In Japan, it is usually called 'Contrabass' (which comes from 
    the instrument's Italian name, contrabbasso).
